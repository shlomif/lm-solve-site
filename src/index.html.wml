<subject "LM-Solve - a Logic Mazes Solver" />

<p>
LM-Solve is a set of solvers I wrote for the Logic Mazes featured on the 
<a href="http://www.logicmazes.com/">Logic Mazes site</a> and
<a href="http://www.clickmazes.com/">Click Mazes site</a>. They are written 
in Perl and should be very portable.
